# ðŸ¤– OctoPi-UpToDate

*The latest OctoPi release with the latest OctoPrint already included*

This repository automatically updates the OctoPrint installation on the latest OctoPi image
and provides the resulting image ready to flash. Checkout the [releases](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPi-UpToDate/releases).

## How does this work?

A simple update script is run via [CustoPiZer](https://github.com/OctoPrint/CustoPiZer).
All that is done is running the equivalent of `pip install -U OctoPrint==<latest version>`.

## Can I do something like this as well?

Sure, check out [CustoPiZer's README](https://github.com/OctoPrint/CustoPiZer) for 
instructions on how to set up your own image build for modified but clean OctoPi images!

## Are these images available on the download page and in the Raspberry Pi Imager?

Yes, they are!

## I have a problem, where's the issue tracker for this project?

Nowhere, because this really is just a build automation.

If you need support with OctoPrint or OctoPi, [please get in touch on the OctoPrint Community Forums](https://community.octoprint.org).
